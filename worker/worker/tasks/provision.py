# yet, exactly the normal state for most of a reachability-polling
# loop's life, before FirstLogonCommands has run or after a reboot).
# Without this, a single slow/hanging probe stalls whichever loop is
# calling it for as long as pywinrm takes to give up, if it ever does -
# for wait_for_callback's fallback specifically, that meant never
# noticing a real callback landing while stuck on one probe, worse than
# the network gap the fallback exists to work around in the first
