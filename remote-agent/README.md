# DeployCore Remote Management Agent

The agent is a **stock, unmodified RustDesk client**, installed as a headless
Windows service and pointed at this DeployCore instance's own self-hosted
RustDesk server. There is no recompiled/forked RustDesk — the only
DeployCore-authored code is the install script and (optionally) a small tray
companion.

## The one source of truth: the install script

All install logic lives in **`backend/app/services/remote_agent_install.ps1`**.
It: fetches this instance's server config (relay address + public key) using the
enroll token, installs the stock RustDesk client silently, writes a headless
config (`hide-tray`, permanent-password unattended access), installs the
service, generates a local permanent password, and enrolls the machine back
with DeployCore.

**It deliberately does NOT use RustDesk's own `--install-service` CLI flag.**
Confirmed via RustDesk's actual source (`platform/windows.rs`,
`install_service()`): that flag wraps the real work (`sc create`/`start`, plus
copying a tray shortcut into the all-users Startup folder - not something we
want either, see "Branding" below) in a call through Rust's `runas` crate with
`force_prompt(true)`, which unconditionally tries to show a UAC-style
elevation prompt - even when the caller is already SYSTEM. In a Session-0/
no-desktop context (a Scheduled Task, or any unattended deployment - a
provisioned VM never has anyone logged into the console) that prompt can
never be shown or dismissed, so the call hangs forever. Confirmed live: the
transcript log stopped dead at "Installing service..." with no error, ever.
The script instead runs the same underlying `sc.exe` commands directly - no
elevation dance, no hang.

It's delivered two ways, both using that same script:

1. **One-liner (easiest, no download).** The Remote Management tab shows a
   copy-paste command; the server serves the script with its own URL baked in
   (`GET /api/remote/install-script`):
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$env:DC_TOKEN='<enroll-token>'; irm <server>/api/remote/install-script | iex"
   ```

2. **The `.msi`** (`remote-agent/wix/`). A thin WiX wrapper that drops the same
   script and runs it once, passing `SERVERURL` + `ENROLLTOKEN` MSI properties:
   ```
   msiexec /i DeployCoreRemoteAgent.msi /qn SERVERURL="<server>" ENROLLTOKEN=<token>
   ```
   This is also the form the DeployCore deployment pipeline uses automatically
   (see `worker/tasks/provision.py`) when the agent is attached to a template as
   the global "Remote Agent" App Asset.

## Building the `.msi` (automatic)

The MSI can only be built on Windows (WiX), not on the Linux hosts DeployCore
otherwise uses, so `.github/workflows/build-agent-msi.yml` builds it on a
`windows-latest` runner. It runs **automatically on every push that changes the
agent** (the install script or `wix/`), smoke-tests the built MSI (installs it
with `SKIPRUN=1`, checks the payload landed, uninstalls), and publishes it to a
rolling **`agent-latest`** pre-release with a stable URL:

```
https://github.com/santiagotoro2023/deploycore/releases/download/agent-latest/DeployCoreRemoteAgent.msi
```

Pushing an `agent-v*` tag also cuts a normal versioned release.

**You don't need to upload it into DeployCore.** On startup the api container
auto-fetches that MSI and registers it as the global "Remote Agent" App Asset
(`config.remote_agent_msi_url`, `app/services/remote_agent_seed.py`), which is
what the tab's "Download .msi" button and the deployment pipeline both use. To
disable auto-fetch (air-gapped installs), set `REMOTE_AGENT_MSI_URL=` empty and
upload the `.msi` as a global App Asset yourself, then **Set as agent**.

> The MSI's post-install custom-action sequencing is the least-tested part
> (WiX v4 + a commit custom action). CI's smoke test catches authoring/
> sequencing breakage, but the very first real end-to-end install (which does
> reach a live DeployCore server) is still worth eyeballing on a throwaway VM.
> The PowerShell one-liner path depends on none of this and is the guaranteed
> install method.

## Surviving the deployment pipeline's own reboot

When attached to a template, `provision.py` waits only for this wrapper
`.msi`'s own quick self-install to report done - not for the agent's real
work (downloading/installing RustDesk, enrolling), which runs afterward in a
detached Scheduled Task (see "Why not run directly from a custom action"
above). But the deployment pipeline does one unconditional final reboot
("rebooting to finalize configuration") once it considers all app installs
done - which, from its point of view, this one already is. That reboot can
land while the background task is still mid-flight, killing it (confirmed
live: the transcript stopped mid-RustDesk-install with `TerminatingError():
"Die Pipeline wurde beendet."` - "the pipeline was terminated").

The task is registered with an **ONSTART** trigger (not just a one-time
immediate one), so if a reboot does interrupt it, it simply runs again on the
next boot. `remote_agent_install.ps1` is written to make that safe: every
step is idempotent (RustDesk's install is skipped if already present, the
service (re)creation just recreates cleanly, enrollment is explicitly safe to
call more than once), and the script only deletes its own Scheduled Task on a
fully successful run - a failed or interrupted attempt leaves it registered
so the next boot gets another try.

## Branding — RustDesk should be invisible, not a second "DeployCore" program

We install the **stock** RustDesk client (no source recompile — that's the
deliberate call to avoid owning a Rust/Flutter build pipeline), then hide
everything installer-level tweaks can reach, rather than relabeling it — a
renamed "DeployCore..." entry sitting next to the real "DeployCore Remote
Management Agent" entry would still look like two separate programs, which
defeats the point.

**Shows as DeployCore (the only things visible at all):**
- The whole browser/operator experience.
- The notification-area **tray icon** — the DeployCore mark and name. This is
  the `remote-agent/tray/` companion app; it ships with the `.msi` only.
- The `.msi` wrapper package's own Add/Remove Programs entry (name, publisher,
  icon) and the Windows service's display name in services.msc.
- **No "being controlled" window** during a session — suppressed with
  `allow-hide-cm=Y` (permitted because we use a permanent password).

**Actively hidden/suppressed, not shown at all:**
- **RustDesk's own Add/Remove Programs entry** — `SystemComponent=1` on its
  uninstall registry key, the standard mechanism bundled/dependency installers
  use to keep a product out of the visible list entirely. Not renamed - hidden.
- **Desktop/Start Menu/Startup shortcuts and the virtual printer** — suppressed
  via the REAL properties RustDesk's own component Conditions check
  (`DESKTOPSHORTCUTS=0`, `STARTMENUSHORTCUTS=0`, `STARTUPSHORTCUTS=0`,
  confirmed directly against its WiX source, not the `CREATE*`/`INSTALL*`
  names an earlier version of this file used based on stale third-party docs
  that were never checked against source). `STARTUPSHORTCUTS` specifically is
  what stops a "RustDesk Tray" auto-launch shortcut landing in the Startup
  folder - confirmed live as a second, unbranded tray icon on every logon,
  entirely unrelated to `--install-service`. Also a belt-and-suspenders sweep
  that deletes any `RustDesk.lnk` left behind anyway, across every user
  profile.
- **An auto-launched interactive GUI window and its tray icon** — confirmed
  live: some RustDesk builds auto-launch the GUI right after install,
  regardless of the shortcut properties, running as whichever user happens to
  be logged in and reading a totally separate, unconfigured per-user config
  (not the one the install script writes for the actual managed service). The
  script kills any `rustdesk.exe` process immediately after install, before
  it can register itself anywhere further.
- RustDesk's own tray icon on the actual managed service - `hide-tray=Y`.

**The icon is the same mark everywhere** — the tray and the `.msi`'s own icon
are both drawn (by the tray app, GDI+, in CI) from the same DeployCore mark as
the browser favicon (`frontend/public/favicon.svg`) and the in-app logo.

**Still says "RustDesk"** (would need a source recompile to change):
- The `rustdesk.exe` process name in Task Manager.
- The `C:\Program Files\RustDesk` install folder.
- The Windows service's *key* name (`RustDesk`) — only the display name is
  relabeled.

These are low-visibility (you have to open Task Manager or browse Program Files),
and none are seen by the DeployCore operator in normal use.

**Note:** the tray icon ships with the `.msi` only; the copy-paste one-liner
install path still hides/suppresses everything RustDesk-side, just without a
tray app of its own.
