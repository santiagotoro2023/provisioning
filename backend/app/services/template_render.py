# keyboard, not Swiss German) or an explicit "LCID:KLID" pair. Every

# files use, which for a locale's *named* keyboard is always its LCID hex
# with "0000" prefixed as the KLID (confirmed against Microsoft's
# [MS-LCID] reference and real-world unattend.xml examples, e.g. de-CH ->
# "0807:00000807" is the documented way to force the Swiss German layout).
