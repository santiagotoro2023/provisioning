    DeployCore Remote Management Agent installer.

    Installs a stock RustDesk client as a headless Windows service, points it
    at this DeployCore instance's self-hosted server, and enrolls the machine
    so it shows up under Remote Management. RustDesk itself is meant to be
    fully invisible - absorbed into "the Agent" rather than a second, separate
    program - so this also: installs with no Desktop/Start Menu shortcuts or
    virtual printer, kills any interactive RustDesk GUI instance that
    auto-launches post-install (confirmed some builds do this regardless of
    the shortcut properties), and hides RustDesk's own Add/Remove Programs
    entry outright (not just renames it - two "DeployCore..." entries would
    still look like two separate programs). DeployCore's own branded tray
    companion (installed separately by the .msi) is the only local UI shown.

    This is the single source of truth for the install logic. It is:
      * served as-is by  GET /api/remote/install-script  (with the server URL
        baked in) for the one-line install shown on the Remote Management tab, and
      * bundled into the .msi (remote-agent/wix/), where a Scheduled Task the
        MSI's own custom action registers and triggers runs it - deliberately
        NOT run directly from inside the custom action itself, since this
        script's own nested msiexec.exe call (installing the bundled RustDesk
        client) would otherwise collide with the _MSIExecute mutex the outer
        MSI still holds for its whole InstallExecuteSequence. That task
        triggers ONSTART (not just once immediately) - confirmed necessary
        live: the DeployCore deployment pipeline's own unconditional final
        reboot can land mid-script (it doesn't wait for this background task,
        only for the wrapper .msi's own quick self-install), so this script
        has to be safely resumable across that reboot, not just re-runnable
        by choice. See DeployCoreRemoteAgent.wxs's own comments.

    Because a reboot can interrupt this mid-run and the Scheduled Task will
    simply fire it again on the next boot, every step here is written to be
    safe to re-run from scratch: RustDesk's own install is skipped if already
    present, the service (re)creation is idempotent, and the final enrollment
    call is explicitly safe to call more than once (see remote_agent.py).
    Nothing here assumes it's the only or first attempt.

    Run standalone (as Administrator):
      $env:DC_TOKEN = "<enroll-token>"; iwr <server>/api/remote/install-script | iex
    Or with explicit args:
      .\Install-DeployCoreAgent.ps1 -ServerUrl https://deploycore.example.com -EnrollToken <token>

    ponytail: all in PowerShell (no Python/other runtime on the target) and
    driven by RustDesk's own documented CLI flags - nothing here reverse-
    engineers RustDesk internals, so a RustDesk point release won't silently
    break it.

# kept installing anyway on a real deployment despite them being set. Setting

# does not reliably re-serialize a backtick-escaped nested quote for the

# argument") - the actual cause of every "installing service..." point this
# script silently died at or errored at, this whole session, once every

# ENROLLTOKEN via agent-params.ini, the scheduled task's own /tr target).
