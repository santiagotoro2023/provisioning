"""Talks to the self-hosted rustdesk-api server (see docker-compose.yml's
`rustdesk` service and remote-agent/README.md) to turn one enrolled
ManagedHost into a short-lived, login-free web-client URL DeployCore's
frontend can drop into an iframe.

The whole flow, verified against rustdesk-api's own Go source (see the
Remote Management architecture memory for the trail):

  1. Log in once as the DeployCore service account (POST /api/admin/login) ->
     an `api-token` (a custom header, NOT Bearer, for every /api/admin/* call).
     Cached in-process until it stops working, then re-fetched.
  2. Make sure the host's RustDesk ID is in that account's address book, with
     the host's own permanent password on file (POST /api/admin/address_book/create).
  3. Mint a one-time, expiring share link for that peer
     (POST /api/admin/address_book/shareByWebClient) -> a `share_token` that
     redeems anonymously (POST /api/shared-peer needs no login), so the
     operator's browser never needs its own rustdesk-api account.
  4. Hand back <public_url>/webclient2/#/?share_token=<token>.

ponytail: no persistent session store, no token-refresh scheduler - a single
module-level cached token re-fetched on the first 401/expiry is enough for a
low-frequency "operator clicked Connect" call. Revisit only if this ever gets
hammered.

    here, in order:

    1. A direct http://<host>:21114 URL - a plain HTTP iframe embedded in
       DeployCore's own HTTPS-served UI is exactly the "mixed active
       content" browsers block by default. Confirmed live: a black screen
       with no visible error, the RustDesk protocol's own WebSocket
       connections never got a chance to open.
    2. A dedicated :8444 HTTPS port fixed that, but introduced its own
       problem: a SEPARATE origin needs its own certificate trust decision,
       and a browser flatly refuses to let you make that decision from
       INSIDE an embedded iframe at all (the same restriction that stops a
       malicious page tricking someone into trusting a bad cert) - so
       Connect/Shadow silently failed for anyone who hadn't separately
       visited/trusted that port first, with no way to do so from inside
       the session itself.
    3. An earlier same-origin attempt, proxied under a DIFFERENT sub-path
       (/rustdesk-webclient/, prefix stripped before forwarding), also
       failed - not because same-origin is impossible, but because that
       path didn't match what the Flutter web client's own build was
       compiled for (/webclient2/, confirmed via lejianwen/rustdesk-api's
       actual source, http/router/router.go's own StaticFS mount), so its
       root-relative asset/API references resolved incorrectly.

    Proxying webclient2 at the EXACT path it already expects (see
    proxy/entrypoint.sh's /webclient2/* and /api/shared-peer handle blocks -
    the latter confirmed, via the same source, to be the one specific API
    call this anonymous share-token flow actually needs, and confirmed not
    to collide with anything DeployCore's own API uses) means the embedded
    session shares DeployCore's own already-trusted origin entirely - no
    separate certificate, no separate trust decision, for anyone, ever."""
