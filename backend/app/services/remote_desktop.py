"""Talks to the self-hosted rustdesk-api server (see docker-compose.yml's
`rustdesk` service and remote-agent/README.md) to turn one enrolled
ManagedHost into a short-lived, login-free web-client URL DeployCore's
frontend can drop into an iframe.

The whole flow, verified against rustdesk-api's own Go source (see the
Remote Management architecture memory for the trail):

  1. Log in once as the DeployCore service account (POST /api/admin/login) ->
     an `api-token` (a custom header, NOT Bearer, for every /api/admin/* call).
     Cached in-process until it stops working, then re-fetched.
  2. Make sure the host's RustDesk ID is in that account's address book, with
     the host's own permanent password on file (POST /api/admin/address_book/create).
  3. Mint a one-time, expiring share link for that peer
     (POST /api/admin/address_book/shareByWebClient) -> a `share_token` that
     redeems anonymously (POST /api/shared-peer needs no login), so the
     operator's browser never needs its own rustdesk-api account.
  4. Hand back <public_url>/webclient2/#/?share_token=<token>.

ponytail: no persistent session store, no token-refresh scheduler - a single
module-level cached token re-fetched on the first 401/expiry is enough for a
low-frequency "operator clicked Connect" call. Revisit only if this ever gets
hammered.
