        refuses to let a remote/network token drive an actual download or
        install. Running the same script under SYSTEM via Task Scheduler
        sidesteps that restriction entirely - this WinRM session only
        registers/starts the task and polls for it to finish, never runs
        the WUA calls itself.

        Clears ExcludeWUDriversInQualityUpdate first (best-effort, never
        fatal if it can't): some Windows Server images have "Do not
        include drivers with Windows Updates" set via local/group
        policy, which makes the WUA search itself silently exclude every
        Type='Driver' result - confirmed Microsoft-documented behavior
        of that specific policy, not just a Settings-app-UI filter - so
        a driver-inclusive search needs that value gone first or it
        never sees drivers to begin with, no Type filter on the search
        criteria itself would fix that.

        Writes its current stage to a fixed status file throughout
        (search/download/install), read back by get_windows_update_progress
        for the deployment log's heartbeat - the scheduled task has no
        direct way to report progress back to this session otherwise."""
