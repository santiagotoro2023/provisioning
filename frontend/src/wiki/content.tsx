              hypervisor, the VM keeps running exactly as it was until someone removes it directly on the
              hypervisor. It also doesn't erase the organization from the audit log, those entries survive
              with their organization reference cleared, so there's still a permanent record that the

              Use <strong>Test Connection</strong> two ways: against whatever is currently typed into the
              create form, before you've saved anything, or against an already-saved host, which stores
              and displays its last result (status, timestamp, message) so you can see connection health
              at a glance later. <strong>List datastores</strong>, right next to Default datastore, works
              the same "test what's currently typed in, nothing saved yet" way - it fills in that field's
              own live autocomplete list from the endpoint/username/password you've typed so far, no need
              to save the host first just to find out what its datastores are actually called. Deleting a
              hypervisor only removes DeployCore's stored connection and credentials, it never touches the
              hypervisor itself or any VMs already created on it.

              Uploads happen from the browser in 8&nbsp;MB chunks over sequential requests, then a
              finalize call assembles the file, checksums it, and (for a Windows ISO) patches out the
              install media's own "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD..." prompt, see "Unattended
              Windows Setup, in depth" for exactly how. Chunking is deliberate: multi-gigabyte ISOs upload
              reliably without ever holding the whole file in memory on either end, and a flaky connection
              just means a slower upload, not a failed one.

              crossed with Server Core/Desktop Experience, all in one file, selected only by an install-time
              index). This reads the WIM's own embedded XML metadata, it doesn't need to actually install
              anything to know what's available, including which editions actually have a GUI (Desktop
              Experience) versus which are Server Core, read from the WIM's own edition flags rather than
              guessed from the edition's name. Templates use this list to offer a named, GUI/Core-labeled
              edition picker instead of a bare number, see "Templates and Windows roles". An ISO with no
              detectable editions (non-Microsoft media, or an ISO uploaded before this existed) just falls
              back to a plain image-index number field, silently, this never blocks or fails the upload
              itself. If a real Windows ISO unexpectedly gets no editions detected, the reason (couldn't

              metadata, ...) is logged on the <Code>api</Code> container, not shown anywhere in the UI:

              environment should get) - scope is fixed at upload time, not changeable afterward, same as

              re-uploading (a pencil icon on the App Assets table opens the same fields as upload minus
              the file itself, which is immutable - a mistaken kind or a vendor changing their
              silent-install flags doesn't mean deleting and re-uploading, which would also mean
              re-editing every template that references it): a <strong>display name</strong>{" "}
              (independent of the uploaded filename, so "Datto RMM Agent" can be what operators see even
              if the file itself is <Code>AgentSetup_2024.1.exe</Code>), whether it's an <strong>MSI or
              EXE</strong>, and <strong>default silent-install arguments</strong> (e.g. <Code>/qn

              check the vendor's docs, there's no universal standard for EXEs the way MSI has one).
              Multiple flags in one field work fine, including quoted values with spaces (e.g.{" "}
              <Code>/S /v"/qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress"</Code>, the exact string DeployCore's own VMware Tools
              install uses): the whole field is passed through as a single raw command-line string, never
              split into a PowerShell array, specifically so a multi-flag string survives intact instead of

              A template attaches any number of app assets in an ordered list (Templates page, the
              "Software to install" section), each with its own optional argument override, blank means
              "use the asset's own default." Installed over WinRM during post_install, after Windows
              features and RDP, before post-install scripts and the final reboot - so a post-install
              script can assume an app installed earlier in this list is already present, and an app that
              reports needing a reboot to finish actually gets one from that final reboot (briefly moved
              to run after that reboot instead, on the theory that a settled, fully-patched guest is a
              more representative install target - reverted, since that meant an app's own requested
              reboot never happened at all).

              Delivery is guest-initiated: the guest's own <Code>Invoke-WebRequest</Code> downloads each
              installer directly from DeployCore, the worker never pushes file bytes through WinRM itself
              (the same reasoning as the Setup-complete callback: the guest already reaches DeployCore's
              API, so there's no need to chunk a multi-hundred-MB installer through WinRM's own message-size
              limits). That download endpoint is authenticated by a random, single-deployment token
              generated right before the first app install and cleared right after (or on failure), there's
              no user session to authenticate the guest with, the same pattern as the callback token itself.
            </P>
            <P>
              Each install actually runs inside a one-shot, SYSTEM-context Scheduled Task on the guest, not
              directly over the WinRM session driving it: a WinRM/NTLM session is a network logon, which
              some installer frameworks refuse to fully cooperate with (confirmed for Windows Update's own
              COM API), and NSIS-based installers specifically (Firefox's own installer among them) have a
              documented bug class around picking a per-machine-vs-per-user install mode correctly in
              silent mode. Running as SYSTEM sidesteps both, and empirically biases installers toward a
              machine-wide install the same way <Code>winget --scope machine</Code> does, since there's no
              ambiguous "current interactive user" profile to install into instead. The task, its script
              file, and its result file are all removed afterward no matter how the install ends - success,
              a timeout, or a WinRM hiccup mid-poll (confirmed a real, not just theoretical, way to leave
              one behind otherwise) - via a <Code>try</Code>/<Code>finally</Code>, with{" "}
              <Code>Stop-ScheduledTask</Code> alongside <Code>Unregister-ScheduledTask</Code> so a
              genuinely stuck task actually gets killed rather than just deregistered while still running.

              one universal MSI property for a machine-wide install) forced automatically unless{" "}
              <Code>install_args</Code> already sets it; EXE installs run the downloaded file directly with
              the arguments passed straight through - there's no equivalent single flag that works across
              every EXE installer framework, that still has to live in that asset's own{" "}
              <Code>install_args</Code>. Either way, exit code <Code>3010</Code> (success, reboot required)

            <P>
              Verified, not just trusted to have exited cleanly: <Code>-Wait -PassThru</Code> only waits
              for the process directly launched, and a self-relaunching or detached-child installer stub
              can report a clean exit code without the app actually being there yet (confirmed on a real
              deployment). Each install snapshots the registry Uninstall key set (HKLM +{" "}
              <Code>WOW6432Node</Code>, plus HKCU as cheap defense in depth) before running, then polls for
              a new entry to appear afterward for up to 10 minutes - the same approach Chocolatey (
              <Code>Get-UninstallRegistryKey</Code>) and the PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit both use,
              since there's no universal "did this arbitrary installer actually finish" API. If at least
              one installed app reports needing a reboot, that's logged as a warning rather than triggering
              an automatic reboot - forcing one after every deployment with apps installed would cost
              several more minutes for something most apps don't strictly need to be usable.

              <strong>Prefer an MSI package over an EXE installer whenever the vendor offers one.</strong>{" "}
              Confirmed the hard way with Firefox: a generic vendor "download" link/button can silently
              hand you the small stub installer (a bootstrapper that fetches the real payload over the
              network <em>during</em> the silent install itself) rather than the self-contained full/offline
              installer, with no obvious naming difference and no error at all if that runtime fetch fails
              quietly under whatever network/proxy context the install actually runs in - it exits{" "}
              <Code>0</Code> having installed nothing, and looks identical in the deployment log to a
              genuinely finished install right up until the registry-diff verification above (correctly)
              never sees a new entry appear. Mozilla's own enterprise/automation guidance is to use their
              official MSI instead of either EXE variant, for exactly this reason. MSI sidesteps the whole
              problem structurally: it's always a single self-contained package (no stub/full ambiguity to
              accidentally pick the wrong one of), <Code>ALLUSERS=1</Code> is forced automatically without
              needing to know a given vendor's own EXE conventions, and <Code>msiexec</Code>'s exit codes
              are standardized rather than installer-framework-specific. If an app only ships as EXE,
              prefer the vendor's explicitly-labeled "full"/"offline" installer over whatever a plain
              "Download" button on their homepage serves by default.

              <strong>Setting a recovery partition size is what avoids the well-known "recovery partition

              size left unset) is to append its own WinRE recovery partition <em>after</em> the OS volume -
              fine until you try to expand the disk later in your hypervisor, since the recovery partition
              sitting right after C: blocks it from ever being extended into that new space, the "disk

            </P>
            <P>
              That partition is created deliberately <strong>raw</strong> during Setup - no format, no

              real deployment's Setup fail its own BCD creation outright. The default global layout ships

              image Windows Setup ends up creating on its own (usually a separate partition at the end of
              the disk, since it doesn't know about the pre-created one until this script points it there),
              applies it into the pre-created partition, repoints <Code>reagentc</Code> at the new
              location, hides the relocated partition, deletes Setup's own leftover one, and extends C:
              into the freed space - replicating a technique documented in the "Windows disk layout from
              hell" writeups this feature is modeled on, adapted to run automatically instead of by hand

              for a deployment using this layout - before VMware Tools, before any Windows feature install,
              before the template's own post-install scripts. That's deliberate: disk/partition fixups
              (diskpart, DISM, reagentc, bcdedit) need a pristine, freshly-booted disk before anything else
              has a chance to touch it. A failure here stops the deployment rather than continuing past it,
              unlike app installs - partition operations are exactly the kind of step where continuing past
              a failure could make things worse, not just skip a step.

              Every checked role installs together in a single{" "}
              <Code>Install-WindowsFeature -Name @(...) -IncludeManagementTools</Code> call, not one call
              per role, the same thing Server Manager's own "Add Roles and Features" wizard does — a
              single DISM/CBS transaction, meaningfully faster than installing each one separately.{" "}
              <Code>-IncludeManagementTools</Code> is always on: on a Desktop Experience (GUI) edition
              this brings in the matching graphical console for whatever you checked (Active Directory
              Users and Computers and Group Policy Management for AD DS, the DNS console, the DHCP
              console, and so on), on Server Core it installs whatever's applicable instead (PowerShell
              modules/CLI tools) and silently skips the GUI-only pieces rather than failing — matching
              what installing through Server Manager's own GUI gives you by default either way, no
              separate option needed. Before the install call runs, DeployCore waits (up to 120s) for the
              guest's <Code>TrustedInstaller</Code> service to go idle — right after first boot it can
              still be busy from the image finishing up, and running into it mid-lock produces a transient{" "}
              <Code>0x80070020</Code> error that a bare retry alone can't reliably outrun; a 3-attempt/
              30s-apart retry stays in place as a safety net for that same error regardless. While the
              install runs, the deployment log's periodic "still running" heartbeat also reports live
              per-role progress (e.g. "2/4 installed so far: DNS, AD-Domain-Services"), polled over a{" "}
              <em>separate</em> WinRM connection from the one actually running the install — sharing one
              connection between the two corrupts NTLM's own message-signing state. A verification pass
              (<Code>Get-WindowsFeature</Code>) confirms every requested role actually ended up installed
              before anything else in post-install proceeds, and one reboot happens automatically right
              here, before continuing, if any of them reported needing one.

              <strong>Important limitation:</strong> installing a role only installs that role's binaries

              Other things a template can do: <strong>Clone</strong> duplicates any visible template (your
              own, or an inherited global one) into a new org-scoped copy, including its encrypted
              credentials. <strong>Export</strong>/<strong>Import</strong> round-trip a template as JSON
              (credentials excluded from export; import sets a random placeholder admin password you must
              replace before it can deploy). <strong>Preview</strong> renders the exact{" "}
              <Code>autounattend.xml</Code> that a given hostname/network configuration would produce,
              without creating a deployment, byte-identical to what actually ships. For a deployment that
              already exists, its own detail page has a <strong>View answer file</strong> section instead,
              the exact XML that one actually shipped with, stored once rendered rather than re-derived,
              so it stays correct even if the template it came from is edited afterward.

            <P>
              <strong>Delete</strong> always succeeds even if deployments were created from that template:
              a deployment doesn't need its template to exist afterward, it keeps its own rendered answer
              file and settings, deleting only clears the now-dangling reference on those deployment rows
              rather than being blocked by them. The one edge case is a deployment that's still actively
              provisioning (or gets retried) after its template was deleted mid-flight, that fails with an
              explicit error in its log rather than deploying from a template that no longer exists.

                  floppy alike (drives kept, emptied — ESXi rejects actually removing a floppy device
                  while the VM is still powered on, which this always runs while it is), and deletes the
                  per-deployment answer-file floppy image from the datastore, all best-effort and never
                  worth failing an otherwise-successful deployment over. The floppy device itself does get
                  fully removed later, not left ejected forever — see the VMware Tools reboot further down,
                  the one point in the pipeline the VM is genuinely powered off. Nothing from here on (post-install
                  runs entirely over WinRM) needs any of it. The wait for that callback isn't
                  all-or-nothing, and in the common, fully-unattended case (see "no human needs to log in"
                  above) it's actually the secondary path, not the primary one: every 30 seconds or so
                  (not every single poll, no reason to check any more eagerly while Setup is still in its
                  much longer earlier phases) it also checks whether the guest has become reachable over
                  WinRM directly. WinRM gets enabled during the specialize pass itself now, well before
                  oobeSystem, so this check is normally what actually advances a deployment — a guest
                  answering over WinRM is treated as equally good evidence the install finished, whether
                  or not <Code>FirstLogonCommands</Code>' own callback ever runs at all (it only does if a
                  human ends up logging in manually). A static deployment's own declared IP is used
                  directly for that check rather than asking the hypervisor for one - that lookup needs
                  VMware Tools installed in the guest to report anything at all (installed automatically
                  now too, see "Unattended Windows Setup, in depth" for why and how), and a static
                  deployment already knows its address without asking. Every WinRM reachability check anywhere in
                  this pipeline runs through <Code>asyncio.to_thread</Code> with a hard timeout, not a
                  bare call - a real bug caught during testing: pywinrm has documented gaps in its own
                  timeout handling and can hang well past whatever it's configured with against a host
                  with nothing listening yet (the normal state for most of any reachability loop's
                  lifetime), and a single hanging check was found silently stalling this exact fallback
                  loop entirely - never reacting to a callback that had, in fact, already landed - rather
                  than just failing that one attempt and moving on. When the fallback is what actually
                  advanced the deployment, the log says so explicitly.</>,
                <>A static deployment's IP/netmask/gateway/DNS are set declaratively in the answer file
                  itself (the specialize pass, before Windows Setup even finishes), not reconfigured
                  over WinRM afterward, that would mean connecting at whatever address DHCP handed out
                  first and reassigning it remotely, which can't work at all on a network with no DHCP
                  server to hand out that first address. The answer file targets the NIC by MAC address,
                  not by interface name: matching by name ("Ethernet") turned out not to reliably match
                  the real interface on real hardware — Setup didn't error, the static config just
                  silently never applied and the adapter stayed on its DHCP default — so DeployCore now
                  assigns the VM's NIC a MAC address explicitly at creation time and matches on that
                  instead, deterministic rather than depending on Windows' own enumeration order. Post-
                  install then runs over WinRM once a guest address is known - a static deployment's own
                  declared IP directly, otherwise whatever address the callback request itself arrived
                  from (captured the moment it lands, no need to separately ask anything), and only as a
                  genuine last resort the hypervisor's own guest-IP lookup, which needs VMware Tools
                  installed in the guest to report anything at all and was the actual cause, confirmed
                  live, of a real deployment spinning for a full ten minutes despite Setup and the
                  callback having both already succeeded: install every selected Windows role in a{" "}
                  <strong>single</strong> <Code>Install-WindowsFeature -Name @(...) -IncludeManagementTools</Code>{" "}
                  call, not one call per role — the same thing Server Manager's own "Add Roles and
                  Features" wizard does (select several, click Install once), a single DISM/CBS
                  transaction rather than several separate ones. <Code>-IncludeManagementTools</Code> is
                  always on, not conditional on the edition having a GUI: confirmed against Microsoft's
                  own documented behavior, Server Core installs whatever's applicable (PowerShell/CLI
                  tools) and silently skips the GUI-only pieces rather than failing, so a Desktop
                  Experience template gets Active Directory Users and Computers, Group Policy Management,
                  the DNS/DHCP consoles, and so on right alongside whichever roles pull them in — matching
                  what installing through Server Manager's GUI gives you by default, on either edition.
                  This also checks the structured <Code>Success</Code>/<Code>RestartNeeded</Code> fields{" "}
                  <Code>Install-WindowsFeature</Code> itself returns rather than just whether the command
                  ran without throwing (not the same thing — a feature set can report{" "}
                  <Code>Success=False</Code> without ever raising a terminating error), then runs one
                  explicit <Code>Get-WindowsFeature</Code> verification pass across every requested
                  feature once installation reports success, and reboots once if a restart was reported
                  needed, before moving on. If <Code>enable_rdp</Code> is on for the template (the
                  default — WinRM itself is deliberately closed for good once post-install finishes, so
                  leaving RDP off too would mean no remote access at all afterward), <Code>fDenyTSConnections</Code>{" "}
                  gets set to <Code>0</Code> and the built-in "Remote Desktop" firewall rule group gets
                  enabled here too, neither needing a restart to take effect. Then install each attached
                  app asset in order (see "App assets"), run post-install scripts in order, check for
                  Windows updates if enabled for this template/deployment (see below), join the
                  domain here if configured for that timing, reboot, verify it comes back reachable, then
                  mark the deployment completed. Each of those steps — the feature install, RDP, app
                  installs, scripts, the domain join — logs a "still running" heartbeat every 30 seconds
                  while it hasn't finished yet, rather than the deployment log going silent for however
                  long that guest-side command actually takes: a real Windows role install can
                  legitimately run several minutes, and without this a genuinely-still-working deployment
                  looked indistinguishable from a stuck one. Every reboot here requires 3 consecutive
                  successful reachability checks, not just one, using a brand-new WinRM connection for
                  each check rather than the pre-reboot one (a real reboot can leave pooled HTTP
                  connections stuck reusing a half-dead socket, which looked exactly like "the guest is
                  reachable by every other means but this check won't agree" on a real deployment), and
                  logs the guest's own boot timestamp from before and after as proof a reboot actually
                  happened, rather than the guest simply having stayed reachable the whole time.</>,
                <><strong>Windows Update</strong> is on by default, toggled off per template (an{" "}
                  <Code>install_windows_updates</Code> checkbox, template create/edit and "Customize
                  installation" both, same override mechanism as every other template field) for
                  deployments where speed matters more than shipping fully patched. It searches via the
                  built-in WUA COM API (<Code>Microsoft.Update.Session</Code>), no PSWindowsUpdate module
                  or PSGallery access needed beyond what Windows Update itself already requires, and runs
                  through the same one-shot SYSTEM-context Scheduled Task as app installs (see "App
                  assets") rather than directly over the driving WinRM session — confirmed live that the
                  WUA downloader COM object refuses a WinRM/NTLM network-logon token outright, there's no
                  way to search/download/install updates over that kind of session at all. It skips any
                  individual update over 150MB rather than downloading everything offered — a deliberate,
                  explicitly requested speed trade-off: Windows Server 2019+ no longer ships a separate
                  small "security-only" patch, the monthly Cumulative Update (usually the single largest
                  item offered, often 500MB-1.5GB) <em>is</em> that month's security fix merged into one
                  package, so this does mean skipping that month's OS security patch in favor of
                  everything smaller (drivers, definitions, servicing stack updates) installing quickly.
                  Progress shows up the same way feature-install progress does: a separate WinRM session
                  polls a status file the scheduled task's own script updates while moving through
                  search/download/install phases (e.g. "installing 3 update(s)"), read into the
                  deployment log's heartbeat — an empty read just means the step hasn't started yet or
                  already finished, and a transient failure on that separate polling connection means one
                  heartbeat tick shows no extra detail, not that the install itself stalled, the actual
                  install call is a normal synchronous COM call that can legitimately run for many minutes
                  with nothing finer-grained to report meanwhile. Best-effort throughout: an update-server
                  hiccup or a failed install is logged as a warning, never fails an otherwise-successful
                  deployment.</>,
                <>Role installs and app installs both stay sequential on purpose, not run in parallel
                  across concurrent WinRM sessions: the single-call feature install above is the real,
                  safe speedup, and it's already what Server Manager's own wizard does — Windows' own
                  Component-Based Servicing only ever runs one feature transaction at a time on a given
                  machine regardless of how many separate WinRM sessions tried to start one, so
                  concurrent <Code>Install-WindowsFeature</Code> calls wouldn't actually install faster in
                  parallel, they'd just contend for the same lock. App installs have the same shape for
                  anything MSI-based: the Windows Installer service also only runs one transaction at a
                  time system-wide, a second concurrent <Code>msiexec</Code> just fails with "another
                  installation is already in progress" rather than actually running alongside the first.
                  Non-MSI EXE installers could plausibly run concurrently, but not reliably enough across
                  arbitrary, operator-supplied installers to build automation around by default.</>,
                <>A stuck deployment (past its configured timeout, default 90 minutes, editable per
                  organization in Settings) is force-failed automatically by a background job, and cleaned
                  up the same way a real failure would be. This is independent of, and a genuine safety
                  net for, a separate fix: arq's own default per-job timeout is 300 seconds, which
                  silently killed the worker job waiting on the callback mid-poll on real deployments
                  before this was caught - a guest that had genuinely finished installing and called back
                  successfully still sat in <Code>installing_os</Code> forever, because the job watching
                  for that callback got forcibly cancelled five minutes in, every time, regardless of
                  network conditions or anything else actually being wrong. That job (and the one it runs
                  straight into once the callback lands, in the same execution, not a separately queued
                  job) now has an explicit, much longer timeout of its own.</>,

            <P>
              From the deployment's detail page you can retry, or power the VM on/shut it down
              gracefully/power it off hard. Retry comes in two forms: a full retry from scratch always
              builds a fresh VM (deleting the previous one first, if any) - available once a deployment is{" "}
              <Code>failed</Code>. A post-install-only retry re-enters the pipeline directly against the{" "}
              <em>same</em> VM instead, and is only offered when there is one to reuse: a failure before
              Windows Setup itself has finished (before reaching <Code>post_install</Code>/
              <Code>configuring</Code>) still deletes the VM the same as always - nothing usable exists yet
              at that point - but a failure after Setup already succeeded (a bad post-install script, a
              feature install error, an app that wouldn't verify) now keeps the VM instead of throwing it
              away, since it's usually just a one-line fix away from finishing rather than a reason to
              build an entire new VM and sit through Setup again. Either form of retry clears the
              deployment's prior log lines (not the state-transition history, which is the real audit trail
              and keeps every past attempt visible as its own row) - without it, a retry's log just kept
              appending onto the previous failed attempt's with nothing marking where one ended and the
              next began, reading exactly like the retry had silently done nothing. The page itself also
              reopens a fresh live-event connection on retry: the event stream deliberately closes for good
              the first time it sees a transition into <Code>completed</Code>/<Code>failed</Code>, so a
              page left open across a retry would otherwise show the state flip back once (from the
              retry's own immediate refetch) and then simply never update again, no matter how far the
              retried run actually got - indistinguishable from the retry having done nothing at all. There's no dedicated "delete just the VM"
              action, remove it directly on the hypervisor if you want it gone without deleting the
              deployment record too - the one place a VM does get deleted automatically is on a failure
              before that Setup-succeeded point, as part of marking it <Code>failed</Code>. On ESXi, that
              delete follows up <Code>Destroy_Task</Code> with an explicit, best-effort cleanup of the VM's
              datastore folder. A real deployment showed a folder always left behind after delete, traced
              back to VM creation itself: the file path handed to ESXi when creating the VM
              (<Code>vmPathName</Code>) was a valid but ambiguous form whose exact resolution is left up to
              the host, and this ESXi version resolved it one folder too deep - fixed at the source by
              spelling out the exact file path instead, so only one folder gets created per VM going
              forward. The delete-time cleanup still runs regardless, a no-op in the normal case, as
              insurance against the separate, genuinely rare file-lock race right after power-off that can
              still occasionally leave <Code>Destroy_Task</Code>'s own cleanup incomplete. The{" "}
              <strong>Download full log</strong> button produces one plain-text file
              with the deployment's details, full state history, and every log line, the fastest way to
              hand off a failure to someone else or attach to a support ticket.

              <strong>Delete deployment</strong> (admin only) is for cleaning up ones you don't need in
              the list anymore, a pile of old failed attempts, one that's stuck mid-pipeline, say.
              Available at any stage, not just terminal ones. Deleting it doesn't touch the hypervisor at
              all: if a VM still exists for it, that VM keeps running exactly as before, DeployCore just
              stops tracking it, it's no longer reachable through this deployment or this UI at all (remove
              it directly on the hypervisor if you want it gone too), and if the pipeline is still actively
              running in the background worker, deleting the deployment doesn't cancel it, that keeps going
              too, just with nothing in the UI showing it anymore.
              It's a soft delete: the deployment disappears from the list and dashboard counts and its
              own detail page stops resolving, but the row, its state history, and its log lines are not
              actually erased, both the <Code>/history</Code> and <Code>/logs</Code> API endpoints keep
              working for its id afterward. There's currently no UI to browse deleted deployments, this
              is meant as a safety margin (and an audit trail via the <Code>deployment.delete</Code>{" "}
              action, which records whether a VM was left running), not an undo button.

              <strong>Disk controller: LSI Logic SAS, not PVSCSI.</strong> This is the first thing that
              can go wrong, before Setup even boots. VMware's own paravirtualized SCSI controller
              (PVSCSI) has real performance advantages, but Windows has no in-box driver for it at all:
              a disk attached to a PVSCSI controller can't be recognized during Setup, or on the guest's
              own later boots, without the VMware Tools PVSCSI driver injected into the install media
              first (<Code>PnpCustomizationsWinPE</Code>/<Code>DriverPaths</Code>, plus registering it as
              a boot-critical driver), which this pipeline doesn't do, there's no injection step anywhere
              in it. Depending on the exact Windows build and ESXi version, that can look like it's
              working, WinPE can sometimes still read/write the disk well enough to partition it and copy
              files, right up until the point Setup reboots to continue on the disk it just installed to
              and the guest's own kernel can't find a driver for the controller it's booting from, which
              surfaces as a generic "the computer was unexpectedly restarted" dialog with no useful detail
              about the real cause. LSI Logic SAS has been a Windows in-box driver for every Server
              version this tool targets for well over a decade, no injection needed, at the cost of
              PVSCSI's IOPS/CPU-overhead edge, worth it for a pipeline that has to boot correctly with
              nobody watching every single time.

              right after creation (best-effort, a separate step from VM creation itself so a failure here
              never blocks a deployment): ESXi presents an absolute-positioning USB tablet over it
              automatically, no VMware Tools required. Without it, a fresh guest only has the default PS/2

              show up or move with the actual pointer at all, only really noticeable if you open the
              console yourself (post-install itself is entirely WinRM-driven, it never needs the console or
              a working mouse for anything). Confirmed against Packer's own <Code>vsphere-iso</Code> builder
              source, which constructs exactly <Code>VirtualUSBXHCIController</Code> with no other

              <strong>The "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD..." prompt.</strong> This isn't part of
              Windows Setup, it's the Windows install ISO's own UEFI boot loader, and Setup has no say over
              it via <Code>autounattend.xml</Code>, there's no answer-file setting that suppresses it.
              Every stock Windows install ISO ships two UEFI boot images in its El Torito boot catalog: the
              normal one that prints the prompt and waits indefinitely for a keystroke, and a second,
              silent one (<Code>efi/microsoft/boot/efisys_noprompt.bin</Code>) that Microsoft built for
              exactly this scenario, unattended deployment tooling like WDS/MDT relies on it. DeployCore
              patches this once, the moment a Windows ISO finishes uploading (not per deployment): it finds
              both boot images inside the ISO and rewrites the boot catalog's actual UEFI entry to point at
              the silent one's content instead, using <Code>xorriso</Code> in "modify, don't fully rebuild"
              mode so nothing else about the ISO changes. If a particular ISO doesn't have that second boot
              image (non-standard media), the swap is skipped and the ISO is left exactly as uploaded
              rather than failing the upload over it.

              <strong>Delivering the answer file.</strong> It ships on a floppy image, not a second
              CD-ROM. A second CD-ROM does work for most of the answer file (Windows Setup finds and
              applies it: disk partitioning, install, domain join, admin password, all unattended), but
              empirically not reliably for the very first implicit check, the one deciding whether to show
              the interactive language/time/keyboard screen at all, which runs before Setup's driver stack
              is fully up. A floppy is both checked earlier and higher-precedence there, per Microsoft's
              own documented implicit-search order for removable media, which is what makes it reliable
              for that one specific check.

              <strong>Boot order: disk before CD-ROM, not the other way around.</strong> This is a
              documented Packer/vSphere-iso gotcha, not anything specific to this setup, but it's easy to
              get backwards. On the very first boot the disk is blank, the firmware fails it and falls
              through to the CD-ROM within the same boot pass, which is exactly what ESXi's{" "}
              <Code>bootRetryEnabled</Code>/<Code>bootDelay</Code> are tuned for (they also cover a freshly
              attached CD-ROM not being fully connected the instant the VM powers on). Windows Setup writes
              a bootloader to the disk partway through installation and reboots to continue there; with
              CD-ROM first in the boot order, that reboot lands back in the CD's own WinPE instead, and
              Setup throws "the computer was unexpectedly restarted" since it finds itself back in a fresh
              WinPE with no memory of the in-progress install, well before OOBE or any WinRM/callback
              activity, which is also why this specific failure never shows up in the deployment's log
              stream, DeployCore has no visibility into the guest yet at that point. Disk-first avoids it
              entirely: once the disk has a bootloader, every later boot goes straight to it and the

              auto-logon state itself being what this Windows Server build's OOBE launch chokes on here,
              not "any specialize-pass automation" in general, since role installs, static IP, and

              So instead: WinRM is a <em>service</em>, not an interactive session, and getting it

              there's no way to be confident in advance that was specifically the WMI/CIM issue rather
              than something more general about PowerShell's own startup this early) plus a{" "}

              end up at the console (troubleshooting, or if the specialize-pass step somehow didn't take
              for a specific deployment) — redundant with it in the common case, harmless either way. Setup
              always requires the built-in Administrator account to have a password regardless (
              <Code>AdministratorPassword</Code>), so it always gets one whether or not it ends up being

              The WinRM-reachability fallback isn't a complete answer by itself, though: for a{" "}
              <strong>DHCP</strong> deployment specifically, it depends on{" "}
              <Code>HypervisorDriver.get_guest_ip()</Code>, which needs VMware Tools (or hypervisor-level
              DHCP snooping that isn't guaranteed on every host/ESXi version) to report anything — and
              Tools isn't installed until <em>after</em> <Code>installing_os</Code> finishes, a
              chicken-and-egg gap that left a real deployment sitting in <Code>installing_os</Code>{" "}
              indefinitely despite Windows Setup having genuinely completed (confirmed directly on the
              console) — neither the callback (needs a login that never happens) nor the fallback (needs
              an IP that was never reported) ever fired.

            <P>
              Fixed with a dedicated <strong>network ping</strong>, not by reusing the main callback:{" "}
              <Code>_specialize_network_ping.xml.j2</Code> POSTs to{" "}
              <Code>/api/callback/{"{"}token{"}"}/network-ping</Code> unconditionally during the specialize
              pass, via <Code>curl.exe</Code> (an inbox tool on Server 2019+, same reasoning as{" "}
              <Code>winrm.cmd</Code> over <Code>Enable-PSRemoting</Code> — native, not PowerShell, avoiding
              that same specialize-pass crash risk). That route only ever records{" "}
              <Code>guest_reported_ip</Code> — it deliberately does <strong>not</strong> set{" "}
              <Code>callback_token_used</Code>. An earlier version hit the main callback route directly
              instead, which broke the one invariant <Code>wait_for_callback</Code>'s whole poll loop
              depends on: that <Code>callback_token_used</Code> being true means Setup is actually, fully
              done. It used to only ever get set from <Code>FirstLogonCommands</Code>, which only runs
              after Setup completely finishes (OOBE included, past any of Setup's own later internal
              reboots) — specialize runs minutes before that, so the earlier version let{" "}
              <Code>wait_for_callback</Code> see <Code>callback_token_used</Code> flip true while Setup was
              still actively mid-install, immediately ejecting the install media (which Setup might still
              have needed) and handing off to <Code>run_post_install</Code>, which then polled WinRM
              against a guest that hadn't actually finished installing yet — confirmed on a real deployment
              that looked stuck with nothing network-related to explain it. The WinRM-reachability fallback
              above now checks <Code>guest_reported_ip</Code> before falling back to{" "}
              <Code>get_guest_ip()</Code>, so a DHCP guest's address is available from this ping well
              before Tools would ever report one — but that fallback still only ever proceeds once WinRM is
              genuinely, repeatedly reachable, exactly the same completion guarantee a landed callback
              always provided, so nothing here shortcuts it.

              A single bare <Code>curl.exe</Code> call wasn't actually enough either, confirmed live: curl's

              HTTP 408/429/5xx) — <strong>not</strong> "connection refused" or "network unreachable", which
              is exactly what a DHCP guest gets if the specialize pass reaches this command before DHCP has
              actually finished negotiating a lease, a real race that isn't guaranteed to lose.{" "}

              loop instead — up to 24 attempts, a delay between each — so the retry happens at the "does
              this machine have a working route yet at all" level, not just curl's own narrower definition
              of transient. <Code>ping -n 6 127.0.0.1</Code> as the delay, not <Code>timeout.exe</Code>:{" "}
              <Code>timeout</Code> refuses to run without a real attached console ("ERROR: Input
              redirection is not supported"), which a specialize-pass command never has — pinging loopback
              a fixed number of times is the standard console-independent way to get a few seconds of delay
              in a Windows batch context.

              <Code>WINRM_REACHABILITY_MAX_ATTEMPTS</Code> waiting on exactly that) — though the earlier
              step that first resolves a guest address to open a WinRM connection at all still can't lean
              on Tools either, since Tools isn't installed until after that step already has an address to
              work with; the <Code>guest_reported_ip</Code> capture on the callback route is what actually
              closed that particular gap. The installer runs with{" "}
              <Code>REBOOT=ReallySuppress</Code>: a real, documented VMXNET3 interaction means its network
              driver update needs an actual restart to take effect cleanly, or the guest loses network
              access immediately ("RPC service unavailable"). <Code>run_post_install</Code> restarts right
              after, but only when something was actually installed — if the ISO was never mounted (a
              non-ESXi host, say), it logs that and moves straight on, always best-effort, never worth
              failing a deployment over. A static deployment doesn't need any of this for IP discovery (its
              address is already known declaratively), but gets Tools installed anyway — the static-IP
              cross-check that runs right after benefits from Tools already being up, comparing the
              guest-reported address against the configured static one and logging a <Code>WARN</Code>{" "}

              That restart is a full <strong>shutdown, floppy removal, and power-on</strong> through the
              hypervisor, not a guest-initiated <Code>shutdown.exe /r</Code> like every other reboot in this
              pipeline — since a restart is already happening here regardless, it's also the one point the
              answer-file floppy device can actually be <em>removed</em> instead of just ejected.{" "}

              VM is powered back on regardless rather than left off indefinitely), removes the floppy, then
              powers back on and waits for the guest to settle the exact same way every other reboot in this
              pipeline does. Floppy removal itself is best-effort: the device was already harmless (ejected,
              empty, its actual answer-file image already deleted from the datastore) either way, a failure
              here is logged and moved past rather than failing an otherwise fully-successful deployment.

              would silently break every WinRM command DeployCore runs post-install for the custom account

              this very session's connection is using. Splitting them meant a real chance of a slow or
              interrupted response there causing several minutes of retries (each one opening a fresh
              connection against a rule that's now disabled, guaranteed to fail every time), then
              permanently failing right at the last step of an otherwise fully-succeeded deployment. From
              this point on a completed deployment has no WinRM listener at all, by design: there's no way
              for DeployCore (or anything else) to remotely reconfigure the guest again without an operator

              A consequence worth knowing: nothing in DeployCore checks on a completed deployment's guest

              even listening on 5985 anymore to check. Ongoing reachability/health monitoring is left to
              whatever tooling you already use for that.

                  name, hard capped at 15, and Windows doesn't truncate a longer value the way it does for

              <strong>Teams</strong> (Settings → Teams notifications) messages one specific person directly
              - the one who triggered the event - via Microsoft Graph's <strong>Activity Feed API</strong>: a
              notification banner plus an entry in that person's Activity tab, delivered by an app-only
              (client-credential) Graph call, the same auth pattern as email. This is the actual mechanism
              Microsoft supports for a backend service to message one specific Teams user without hosting a
              full Bot Framework bot - a real 1:1 chat via <Code>POST /chats</Code> needs a second real user
              identity as the chat's other member, which a plain app registration can't be. It reads
              slightly differently from a normal chat message (a banner/Activity-tab entry rather than a
              bubble in a conversation thread), but it's the genuinely-supported "notify this one person"

              A small <Code>proxy</Code> service (Caddy) sits in front of the rest of the stack: it
              terminates TLS on port 443 and redirects any plain HTTP request on port 80 to it, then
              forwards everything else to the frontend unchanged. Until you upload a certificate of
              your own, it uses <Code>tls internal</Code> with Caddy's <Code>on_demand</Code> option,
              which issues a locally-trusted, self-signed certificate on the fly for whatever
              hostname or IP the connection actually came in on (a plain <Code>tls internal</Code>{" "}
              without that option only ever issues one static certificate for{" "}
              <Code>localhost</Code>/<Code>127.0.0.1</Code>, so a LAN IP, a port-forwarded public IP,
              or any other hostname would get no matching certificate and a hard TLS handshake
              failure instead of a normal untrusted-certificate warning). Browsers still flag the
              connection as untrusted either way, nothing vouches for a certificate you generated
              yourself, that's expected. This default starts immediately on boot and never depends
              on the database being reachable, only switching to an uploaded certificate does.
            </P>
            <P>
              To get rid of that warning, upload a certificate and its matching private key (PEM
              format, an unencrypted key, no passphrase) signed by a CA browsers already trust, e.g.
              one from Let's Encrypt or an internal CA your organization's devices already trust. The
              upload is validated before anything changes: the certificate and key have to actually
              match, and the certificate can't already be expired. Once accepted, the proxy picks it
              up within a few seconds on its own, no restart needed.
            </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Switch to self-signed temporarily</strong> flips back to the generated
              certificate without discarding the uploaded one, useful if the uploaded certificate
              expired or you're troubleshooting something unrelated. <strong>Use this certificate
              again</strong> switches back, no re-upload required. Uploading a new certificate always
              switches to it immediately.
            </P>
            <P>
              Mechanically, the switching (not the self-signed default itself) works the same way
              self-update below does: the API writes a <Code>tls_mode</Code> setting straight to
              Postgres, and the <Code>proxy</Code> container polls that same table on an interval and
              reloads Caddy's config when it no longer matches what's currently serving. Neither
              container talks to the other directly.
            </P>
            <P>
              This certificate only covers <strong>browser</strong> traffic to the UI (and, through
              the frontend's own dev proxy, the API calls your browser makes). It has nothing to do
              with how a guest VM calls back to DeployCore during provisioning, that path
              (<Code>APP_PUBLIC_URL</Code>) intentionally stays plain <Code>http://</Code> straight to
              the <Code>api</Code> container's own directly-exposed port 8000, bypassing this proxy
              entirely, because a fresh Windows guest's default PowerShell has no easy way to trust (or
              skip validating) a self-signed certificate. See "Troubleshooting a failed or stuck
              deployment" if a deployment is stuck waiting for that callback.

              The updater checks GitHub for new commits on its own every 5 minutes and that's what
              "commit(s) behind" reflects; <strong>Check for update</strong> forces that check
              immediately instead of waiting, useful right after you know something's been pushed.
              It only looks, nothing is pulled or rebuilt until you click Update now separately. When
              you're behind, a collapsible <strong>What's new</strong> list shows the actual commit
              subject lines the update would bring in, not just the count - computed as{" "}
              <Code>git log HEAD..origin/&lt;branch&gt;</Code> right alongside that same check. After an
              update runs, a second list, <strong>What the last update changed</strong>, shows the same
              thing for whatever actually landed, persisted (not just shown in the instant it finished) so

              Clicking <strong>Update now</strong> pulls the latest code from GitHub, rebuilds, runs any
              new database migrations, and restarts. A modal opens over the page, matching the same style
              used for ISO uploads, with a progress bar tracking each stage (Pulling → Building →
              Restarting → Finalizing) - the page reloads itself automatically once it reports done, no
              manual refresh needed. The app is only unreachable for the last part of that, usually well
              under a minute, and nothing in your database is touched by the update process itself beyond
              the migrations it's supposed to run.

              This works because a small dedicated <Code>updater</Code> container in the stack has access
              to the Docker socket, the same mechanism tools like Portainer or Watchtower use, so it can
              tell the host's Docker daemon what to do. That is a real privilege: that container can, in
              principle, control anything else running on the same Docker host. It's a reasonable
              trade-off for a self-hosted tool where you already control the host, worth knowing before
              you rely on it. Nothing needs configuring for it to find this repo on the host either: it
              asks the Docker API for its own bind mount's source path itself, so it works the same on a
              brand-new install and on an instance that's been running since before this feature existed.
            </P>
            <P>
              If this isn't a git checkout, or that automatic lookup can't work in your particular Docker
              setup (a socket proxy that blocks <Code>docker inspect</Code>, for example), the panel shows
              a clear "self-update unavailable" message with the specific reason instead of failing
              silently, alongside the manual fallback (<Code>git pull &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d
              --build</Code>). Setting <Code>PROJECT_DIR</Code> in <Code>.env</Code> to this repo's
              absolute path on the host overrides the automatic lookup entirely, for the rare setup where
              it can't work. There's no automatic rollback: if a migration or
              restart fails partway through, whatever containers are already running keep running on what
              they had, check the panel's error message and container logs to recover.

              The one per-organization setting with real day-to-day relevance is the{" "}
              <strong>deployment timeout</strong>: a deployment stuck past this many minutes in any
              non-terminal stage is force-failed automatically and cleaned up. It defaults to 90 minutes
              and has its own labeled field on the Settings page; an "Advanced" section underneath still
              exposes the raw key/value store directly (value can be plain text or JSON, stored as JSONB
              either way), for anything that doesn't have a dedicated field yet.
            </P>
            <P>
              Panels that have more than one field to change use a single <strong>Apply changes</strong>{" "}
              button for the whole panel, not one save button per field, so changing several things at
              once is one action, not several.
            </P>

              DeployCore ships with its own default look (an icon and name in the sidebar and sign-in
              screen), but a global admin can replace it with your own MSP's name and logo in a couple of
              clicks, so the people using it see your brand, not a generic dashboard.

              Settings → MSP Organization: set the instance name (shown in the sidebar and sign-in
              screen), and optionally upload a logo (PNG, JPEG, or SVG, up to 5&nbsp;MB, transparent
              backgrounds are preserved, so a mark cut to just the logo itself looks best). Once uploaded,
              your logo replaces DeployCore's own default icon everywhere it appears; removing it reverts
              to the default rather than showing nothing.
            </P>
            <P>
              Every user can additionally set their own profile picture from the Account page (PNG or
              JPEG, under 2&nbsp;MB), shown next to their name in the sidebar and in the Users list. This
              is independent of the instance-wide logo, both can be set at once.

              Dark mode (toggle in the header) is remembered per browser and applies consistently across
              every page, including the sign-in and setup-wizard screens, which also sit on a subtly
              animated background matching whichever theme is active.
