              A deployment turns a template (the recipe) into a real Windows Server VM on one of your
              hypervisors. Before your first deployment you need four things in place: a hypervisor
              connection, a Windows Server ISO, a disk layout, and a template. Most of this only needs
              doing once per organization.
            </P>
            <P>
              The Dashboard shows a "Getting started" checklist with the three setup steps until they're
              all done, so you always know what's missing.

              hypervisor, the VM keeps running exactly as it was until someone removes it directly on the
              hypervisor. It also doesn't erase the organization from the audit log, those entries survive
              with their organization reference cleared, so there's still a permanent record that the

              From the deployment's detail page you can retry a failed deployment from scratch (a fresh VM
              is always created, nothing is reused, so this is always safe), or power the VM on/shut it
              down gracefully/power it off hard. There's no dedicated "delete just the VM" action, remove
              it directly on the hypervisor if you want it gone without deleting the deployment record
              too. The <strong>Download full log</strong> button produces one plain-text file with the
              deployment's details, full state history, and every log line, the fastest way to hand off a
              failure to someone else or attach to a support ticket.

            <P>
              <strong>Delete deployment</strong> (admin only) is for cleaning up ones you don't need in
              the list anymore, a pile of old failed attempts, one that's stuck mid-pipeline, say.
              Available at any stage, not just terminal ones. Deleting it doesn't touch the hypervisor at
              all: if a VM still exists for it, that VM keeps running exactly as before, DeployCore just
              stops tracking it, it's no longer reachable through this deployment (use <strong>Delete
              VM</strong> first, a separate, already-destructive action, if you want that gone too), and
              if the pipeline is still actively running in the background worker, deleting the deployment
              doesn't cancel it, that keeps going too, just with nothing in the UI showing it anymore.
              It's a soft delete: the deployment disappears from the list and dashboard counts and its
              own detail page stops resolving, but the row, its state history, and its log lines are not
              actually erased, both the <Code>/history</Code> and <Code>/logs</Code> API endpoints keep
              working for its id afterward. There's currently no UI to browse deleted deployments, this
              is meant as a safety margin (and an audit trail via the <Code>deployment.delete</Code>{" "}
              action, which records whether a VM was left running), not an undo button.

              A small <Code>proxy</Code> service (Caddy) sits in front of the rest of the stack: it
              terminates TLS on port 443 and redirects any plain HTTP request on port 80 to it, then
              forwards everything else to the frontend unchanged. Until you upload a certificate of
              your own, it uses <Code>tls internal</Code> with Caddy's <Code>on_demand</Code> option,
              which issues a locally-trusted, self-signed certificate on the fly for whatever
              hostname or IP the connection actually came in on (a plain <Code>tls internal</Code>{" "}
              without that option only ever issues one static certificate for{" "}
              <Code>localhost</Code>/<Code>127.0.0.1</Code>, so a LAN IP, a port-forwarded public IP,
              or any other hostname would get no matching certificate and a hard TLS handshake
              failure instead of a normal untrusted-certificate warning). Browsers still flag the
              connection as untrusted either way, nothing vouches for a certificate you generated
              yourself, that's expected. This default starts immediately on boot and never depends
              on the database being reachable, only switching to an uploaded certificate does.
            </P>
            <P>
              To get rid of that warning, upload a certificate and its matching private key (PEM
              format, an unencrypted key, no passphrase) signed by a CA browsers already trust, e.g.
              one from Let's Encrypt or an internal CA your organization's devices already trust. The
              upload is validated before anything changes: the certificate and key have to actually
              match, and the certificate can't already be expired. Once accepted, the proxy picks it
              up within a few seconds on its own, no restart needed.
            </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Switch to self-signed temporarily</strong> flips back to the generated
              certificate without discarding the uploaded one, useful if the uploaded certificate
              expired or you're troubleshooting something unrelated. <strong>Use this certificate
              again</strong> switches back, no re-upload required. Uploading a new certificate always
              switches to it immediately.
            </P>
            <P>
              Mechanically, the switching (not the self-signed default itself) works the same way
              self-update below does: the API writes a <Code>tls_mode</Code> setting straight to
              Postgres, and the <Code>proxy</Code> container polls that same table on an interval and
              reloads Caddy's config when it no longer matches what's currently serving. Neither
              container talks to the other directly.

              The updater checks GitHub for new commits on its own every 5 minutes and that's what
              "commit(s) behind" reflects; <strong>Check for update</strong> forces that check
              immediately instead of waiting, useful right after you know something's been pushed.

            <P>
              Clicking <strong>Update now</strong> pulls the latest code from GitHub, rebuilds, runs any
              new database migrations, and restarts, with a live staged progress indicator (Pulling →
              Building → Restarting → Done). The app is only unreachable for the last part of that,
              usually well under a minute, and nothing in your database is touched by the update process
              itself beyond the migrations it's supposed to run.

              This works because a small dedicated <Code>updater</Code> container in the stack has access
              to the Docker socket, the same mechanism tools like Portainer or Watchtower use, so it can
              tell the host's Docker daemon what to do. That is a real privilege: that container can, in
              principle, control anything else running on the same Docker host. It's a reasonable
              trade-off for a self-hosted tool where you already control the host, worth knowing before
              you rely on it. Nothing needs configuring for it to find this repo on the host either: it
              asks the Docker API for its own bind mount's source path itself, so it works the same on a
              brand-new install and on an instance that's been running since before this feature existed.

              If this isn't a git checkout, or that automatic lookup can't work in your particular Docker
              setup (a socket proxy that blocks <Code>docker inspect</Code>, for example), the panel shows
              a clear "self-update unavailable" message with the specific reason instead of failing
              silently, alongside the manual fallback (<Code>git pull &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d
              --build</Code>). Setting <Code>PROJECT_DIR</Code> in <Code>.env</Code> to this repo's
              absolute path on the host overrides the automatic lookup entirely, for the rare setup where
              it can't work. There's no automatic rollback: if a migration or
              restart fails partway through, whatever containers are already running keep running on what
              they had, check the panel's error message and container logs to recover.
