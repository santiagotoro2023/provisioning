              Use <strong>Test Connection</strong> two ways: against whatever is currently typed into the
              create form, before you've saved anything, or against an already-saved host, which stores
              and displays its last result (status, timestamp, message) so you can see connection health
              at a glance later. Deleting a hypervisor only removes DeployCore's stored connection and
              credentials, it never touches the hypervisor itself or any VMs already created on it.

              Uploads happen from the browser in 8&nbsp;MB chunks over sequential requests, then a
              finalize call assembles the file, checksums it, and (for a Windows ISO) patches out the
              install media's own "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD..." prompt, see "Unattended
              Windows Setup, in depth" for exactly how. Chunking is deliberate: multi-gigabyte ISOs upload
              reliably without ever holding the whole file in memory on either end, and a flaky connection
              just means a slower upload, not a failed one.

              crossed with Server Core/Desktop Experience, all in one file, selected only by an install-time
              index). This reads the WIM's own embedded XML metadata, it doesn't need to actually install
              anything to know what's available, including which editions actually have a GUI (Desktop
              Experience) versus which are Server Core, read from the WIM's own edition flags rather than
              guessed from the edition's name. Templates use this list to offer a named, GUI/Core-labeled
              edition picker instead of a bare number, see "Templates and Windows roles". An ISO with no
              detectable editions (non-Microsoft media, or an ISO uploaded before this existed) just falls
              back to a plain image-index number field, silently, this never blocks or fails the upload
              itself. If a real Windows ISO unexpectedly gets no editions detected, the reason (couldn't
              find <Code>install.wim</Code>/<Code>install.esd</Code>, extraction failed, malformed
              metadata, ...) is logged on the <Code>api</Code> container, not shown anywhere in the UI:

              From the deployment's detail page you can retry a failed deployment from scratch (a fresh VM
              is always created, nothing is reused, so this is always safe), or power the VM on/shut it
              down gracefully/power it off hard. There's no dedicated "delete just the VM" action, remove
              it directly on the hypervisor if you want it gone without deleting the deployment record
              too. The <strong>Download full log</strong> button produces one plain-text file with the
              deployment's details, full state history, and every log line, the fastest way to hand off a
              failure to someone else or attach to a support ticket.
            </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Delete deployment</strong> (admin only) is for cleaning up ones you don't need in
              the list anymore, a pile of old failed attempts, one that's stuck mid-pipeline, say.
              Available at any stage, not just terminal ones. Deleting it doesn't touch the hypervisor at
              all: if a VM still exists for it, that VM keeps running exactly as before, DeployCore just
              stops tracking it, it's no longer reachable through this deployment or this UI at all (remove
              it directly on the hypervisor if you want it gone too), and if the pipeline is still actively
              running in the background worker, deleting the deployment doesn't cancel it, that keeps going
              too, just with nothing in the UI showing it anymore.
              It's a soft delete: the deployment disappears from the list and dashboard counts and its
              own detail page stops resolving, but the row, its state history, and its log lines are not
              actually erased, both the <Code>/history</Code> and <Code>/logs</Code> API endpoints keep
              working for its id afterward. There's currently no UI to browse deleted deployments, this
              is meant as a safety margin (and an audit trail via the <Code>deployment.delete</Code>{" "}
              action, which records whether a VM was left running), not an undo button.

              Getting a Windows Server install to run with genuinely zero interaction, no "press any key,"

              <strong>Disk controller: LSI Logic SAS, not PVSCSI.</strong> This is the first thing that
              can go wrong, before Setup even boots. VMware's own paravirtualized SCSI controller
              (PVSCSI) has real performance advantages, but Windows has no in-box driver for it at all:
              a disk attached to a PVSCSI controller can't be recognized during Setup, or on the guest's
              own later boots, without the VMware Tools PVSCSI driver injected into the install media
              first (<Code>PnpCustomizationsWinPE</Code>/<Code>DriverPaths</Code>, plus registering it as
              a boot-critical driver), which this pipeline doesn't do, there's no injection step anywhere
              in it. Depending on the exact Windows build and ESXi version, that can look like it's
              working, WinPE can sometimes still read/write the disk well enough to partition it and copy
              files, right up until the point Setup reboots to continue on the disk it just installed to
              and the guest's own kernel can't find a driver for the controller it's booting from, which
              surfaces as a generic "the computer was unexpectedly restarted" dialog with no useful detail
              about the real cause. LSI Logic SAS has been a Windows in-box driver for every Server
              version this tool targets for well over a decade, no injection needed, at the cost of
              PVSCSI's IOPS/CPU-overhead edge, worth it for a pipeline that has to boot correctly with
              nobody watching every single time.

              <strong>The "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD..." prompt.</strong> This isn't part of
              Windows Setup, it's the Windows install ISO's own UEFI boot loader, and Setup has no say over
              it via <Code>autounattend.xml</Code>, there's no answer-file setting that suppresses it.
              Every stock Windows install ISO ships two UEFI boot images in its El Torito boot catalog: the
              normal one that prints the prompt and waits indefinitely for a keystroke, and a second,
              silent one (<Code>efi/microsoft/boot/efisys_noprompt.bin</Code>) that Microsoft built for
              exactly this scenario, unattended deployment tooling like WDS/MDT relies on it. DeployCore
              patches this once, the moment a Windows ISO finishes uploading (not per deployment): it finds
              both boot images inside the ISO and rewrites the boot catalog's actual UEFI entry to point at
              the silent one's content instead, using <Code>xorriso</Code> in "modify, don't fully rebuild"
              mode so nothing else about the ISO changes. If a particular ISO doesn't have that second boot
              image (non-standard media), the swap is skipped and the ISO is left exactly as uploaded
              rather than failing the upload over it.

              <strong>Delivering the answer file.</strong> It ships on a floppy image, not a second
              CD-ROM. A second CD-ROM does work for most of the answer file (Windows Setup finds and
              applies it: disk partitioning, install, domain join, admin password, all unattended), but
              empirically not reliably for the very first implicit check, the one deciding whether to show
              the interactive language/time/keyboard screen at all, which runs before Setup's driver stack
              is fully up. A floppy is both checked earlier and higher-precedence there, per Microsoft's
              own documented implicit-search order for removable media, which is what makes it reliable
              for that one specific check.

              <strong>Boot order: disk before CD-ROM, not the other way around.</strong> This is a
              documented Packer/vSphere-iso gotcha, not anything specific to this setup, but it's easy to
              get backwards. On the very first boot the disk is blank, the firmware fails it and falls
              through to the CD-ROM within the same boot pass, which is exactly what ESXi's{" "}
              <Code>bootRetryEnabled</Code>/<Code>bootDelay</Code> are tuned for (they also cover a freshly
              attached CD-ROM not being fully connected the instant the VM powers on). Windows Setup writes
              a bootloader to the disk partway through installation and reboots to continue there; with
              CD-ROM first in the boot order, that reboot lands back in the CD's own WinPE instead, and
              Setup throws "the computer was unexpectedly restarted" since it finds itself back in a fresh
              WinPE with no memory of the in-progress install, well before OOBE or any WinRM/callback
              activity, which is also why this specific failure never shows up in the deployment's log
              stream, DeployCore has no visibility into the guest yet at that point. Disk-first avoids it
              entirely: once the disk has a bootloader, every later boot goes straight to it and the
              CD-ROM is never touched again.

              guest has booted into the installed OS for the first time, that's the one point it's safe to
              say the install media is no longer needed by anything (post-install runs entirely over WinRM
              afterward, authenticated as <Code>local_admin_username</Code>, whichever account that
              actually is). That callback is what DeployCore waits for before it ejects the Windows and
              VirtIO ISOs (drive kept, just emptied, matching how you'd eject a real disc), removes the
              floppy device entirely (it only ever had one job), and deletes the per-deployment answer-file
              floppy image from the datastore. All of this is best-effort: a failure here is logged but

              <strong>Closing WinRM once post-install is done.</strong> WinRM is only ever needed while
              DeployCore itself is actively configuring the guest; leaving it open indefinitely afterward
              is unnecessary attack surface. The very last WinRM action of a deployment, right before it's
              marked <Code>completed</Code>, removes the WinRM firewall rule, runs{" "}
              <Code>Disable-PSRemoting -Force</Code>, and stops and disables the WinRM service itself. That
              last part runs in a short-delayed detached process rather than inline, so the command doesn't
              try to report its own success back over the exact channel it's in the middle of tearing down.
              From this point on a completed deployment has no WinRM listener at all, by design: there's no
              way for DeployCore (or anything else) to remotely reconfigure the guest again without an
              operator opening it back up on the guest directly.
            </P>
            <P>
              This is also why the post-deploy health check (see the Deployments article) doesn't use
              WinRM: it can't, by the time a deployment reaches <Code>completed</Code> nothing is listening
              on 5985 anymore. It checks a plain TCP connect to port 3389 (RDP, on by default on every
              Windows Server SKU) instead, proof the guest OS is up and reachable on the network, not that
              remote management still works, since deliberately nothing does.

                  DeployCore has no visibility into it at all, since it happens before the guest has ever
                  reached a state where it could call back (nothing shows in the log stream, the
                  deployment just eventually times out). The most common cause by far: the hostname is
                  longer than 15 characters. <Code>ComputerName</Code> in the specialize pass is a NetBIOS
                  name, hard capped at 15, and Windows doesn't truncate a longer value the way it does for
                  some other name fields, it fails to process the whole answer file instead. DeployCore
                  now blocks this at submission (both the wizard and the API reject a hostname/bulk prefix
                  that doesn't fit), but a deployment created before that validation existed, or an

              A small <Code>proxy</Code> service (Caddy) sits in front of the rest of the stack: it
              terminates TLS on port 443 and redirects any plain HTTP request on port 80 to it, then
              forwards everything else to the frontend unchanged. Until you upload a certificate of
              your own, it uses <Code>tls internal</Code> with Caddy's <Code>on_demand</Code> option,
              which issues a locally-trusted, self-signed certificate on the fly for whatever
              hostname or IP the connection actually came in on (a plain <Code>tls internal</Code>{" "}
              without that option only ever issues one static certificate for{" "}
              <Code>localhost</Code>/<Code>127.0.0.1</Code>, so a LAN IP, a port-forwarded public IP,
              or any other hostname would get no matching certificate and a hard TLS handshake
              failure instead of a normal untrusted-certificate warning). Browsers still flag the
              connection as untrusted either way, nothing vouches for a certificate you generated
              yourself, that's expected. This default starts immediately on boot and never depends
              on the database being reachable, only switching to an uploaded certificate does.
            </P>
            <P>
              To get rid of that warning, upload a certificate and its matching private key (PEM
              format, an unencrypted key, no passphrase) signed by a CA browsers already trust, e.g.
              one from Let's Encrypt or an internal CA your organization's devices already trust. The
              upload is validated before anything changes: the certificate and key have to actually
              match, and the certificate can't already be expired. Once accepted, the proxy picks it
              up within a few seconds on its own, no restart needed.
            </P>
            <P>
              <strong>Switch to self-signed temporarily</strong> flips back to the generated
              certificate without discarding the uploaded one, useful if the uploaded certificate
              expired or you're troubleshooting something unrelated. <strong>Use this certificate
              again</strong> switches back, no re-upload required. Uploading a new certificate always
              switches to it immediately.
            </P>
            <P>
              Mechanically, the switching (not the self-signed default itself) works the same way
              self-update below does: the API writes a <Code>tls_mode</Code> setting straight to
              Postgres, and the <Code>proxy</Code> container polls that same table on an interval and
              reloads Caddy's config when it no longer matches what's currently serving. Neither
              container talks to the other directly.
            </P>
            <P>
              This certificate only covers <strong>browser</strong> traffic to the UI (and, through
              the frontend's own dev proxy, the API calls your browser makes). It has nothing to do
              with how a guest VM calls back to DeployCore during provisioning, that path
              (<Code>APP_PUBLIC_URL</Code>) intentionally stays plain <Code>http://</Code> straight to
              the <Code>api</Code> container's own directly-exposed port 8000, bypassing this proxy
              entirely, because a fresh Windows guest's default PowerShell has no easy way to trust (or
              skip validating) a self-signed certificate. See "Troubleshooting a failed or stuck
              deployment" if a deployment is stuck waiting for that callback.

              tell the host's Docker daemon what to do. That is a real privilege: that container can, in
              principle, control anything else running on the same Docker host. It's a reasonable
              trade-off for a self-hosted tool where you already control the host, worth knowing before
              you rely on it. Nothing needs configuring for it to find this repo on the host either: it
              asks the Docker API for its own bind mount's source path itself, so it works the same on a
              brand-new install and on an instance that's been running since before this feature existed.

              If this isn't a git checkout, or that automatic lookup can't work in your particular Docker

              a clear "self-update unavailable" message with the specific reason instead of failing
              silently, alongside the manual fallback (<Code>git pull &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d

              absolute path on the host overrides the automatic lookup entirely, for the rare setup where
              it can't work. There's no automatic rollback: if a migration or
              restart fails partway through, whatever containers are already running keep running on what
              they had, check the panel's error message and container logs to recover.

              screen), and optionally upload a logo (PNG, JPEG, or SVG, up to 5&nbsp;MB, transparent
              backgrounds are preserved, so a mark cut to just the logo itself looks best). Once uploaded,
              your logo replaces DeployCore's own default icon everywhere it appears; removing it reverts
              to the default rather than showing nothing.

              Every user can additionally set their own profile picture from the Account page (PNG or
              JPEG, under 2&nbsp;MB), shown next to their name in the sidebar and in the Users list. This
              is independent of the instance-wide logo, both can be set at once.
            </P>

              Dark mode (toggle in the header) is remembered per browser and applies consistently across
              every page, including the sign-in and setup-wizard screens, which also sit on a subtly
              animated background matching whichever theme is active.
