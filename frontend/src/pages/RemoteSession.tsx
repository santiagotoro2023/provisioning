  // Two DIFFERENT things, both needed, confirmed against RustDesk's own

  // 1. sessionSetViewStyle sets 'adaptive' (flutter/lib/consts.dart's
  //    kRemoteViewStyleAdaptive) instead of 'original' - VISUAL scaling of
  //    whatever the remote resolution already is, down/up to fit the
  //    container.
  // 2. sessionChangeResolution actually changes the VM's own display
  //    resolution to the nearest real supported mode (see
  //    nearestResolution above) - a real, separate feature (bridge.dart's
  //    changeResolution), confirmed genuinely present in the web build.
  //
  // Both go through the exact same mechanism: a plain global JS function,
  // `window.setByName(name, jsonEncode(value))` - not a postMessage API -
  // so same-origin access lets us call them directly, the same way the
  // embedded app's own UI would. display: 0 assumes a single monitor,
  // true for every VM this connects to.
  //
  // Confirmed against RustDesk's OWN actual production bundle
  // (rustdesk.com/web/js/dist/index.js - lejianwen's webclient2 is a
  // straight, unmodified copy of it, confirmed via its own source and its
  // own maintainer's own words in lejianwen/rustdesk-api#60: "I don't have
  // the source code either... comes from rustdesk.com/web/") that these two
  // calls are gated by the SAME underlying session object (`curConn`) in
  // two DIFFERENT ways:
  //   case "option:session": curConn.setOption(...)             <- THROWS if curConn is null
  //   case "change_resolution": curConn==null || curConn.change...  <- SILENTLY NO-OPS if curConn is null
  // This is the actual, verified bug in the previous version of this fix:
  // it marked a resolution as "already sent" (lastResolutionRef) the
  // moment it was ATTEMPTED, including the very first attempt - when
  // curConn is essentially always still null. change_resolution failed
  // completely silently there (no throw, nothing to catch), so the dedup
  // logic then refused to ever retry that exact value again, even once the
  // session became ready seconds later. Only mark it "sent" when
  // option:session's throw/no-throw - a reliable proxy, since both are set
  // by the same object in the same JS tick - confirms curConn is actually
  // there, so change_resolution's call in the SAME invocation is a real
  // one, not another silent no-op.
  //
  // change_resolution is also NOT idempotent the way the others are - it
  // tears down and renegotiates the live video stream every time it's
  // called, confirmed live as the actual cause of an earlier version of
  // this fix repeatedly calling it on a blind timer: constant "WebSocket
  // already CLOSING/CLOSED" churn, resolution never stable, and materially
  // worse responsiveness, all from the SAME call meant to fix
  // responsiveness. lastResolutionRef (now only updated on a CONFIRMED-live

  // measured size can genuinely cross between two different
  // nearestResolution buckets a couple of times within the first second or
  // two - each one is a genuinely DIFFERENT target, so the dedup correctly
  // lets each through, and each one still tears down and rebuilds the
  // video stream (confirmed live: repeated "WebSocket already CLOSING/
