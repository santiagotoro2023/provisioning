# Terminates HTTPS for the whole app and redirects plain HTTP to it. By
# default that's Caddy's own `tls internal`, a zero-config self-signed
# certificate backed by a local CA it generates once and reuses (persisted
# under /data, a named volume, so restarts don't churn out a new one).
# THIS PART MUST NEVER DEPEND ON POSTGRES BEING UP: it's what a user sees
# on the very first boot of a fresh install, before migrations have
# necessarily even finished, and it's also the only thing standing between
# them and a working HTTPS port at all, so it starts immediately no matter
# what Postgres is doing.
#
# Which certificate to use beyond that default is controlled from Settings
# -> HTTPS certificate, which writes a `tls_mode` row straight to Postgres
# the same way every other setting does (see
# backend/app/api/routes/settings.py). This container has no other way to
# learn about that change, so, same idea as updater/update.sh polling for
# update_requested, it polls the settings table on an interval in the
# background and reloads Caddy's config when what it finds no longer
# matches what's currently running. If Postgres or psql is ever
# unreachable, that polling just quietly finds nothing to do, self-signed
# (or whatever was last loaded) keeps serving either way.

	# separate origin needs its own certificate trust decision, which a
	# browser flatly refuses to let you make from INSIDE an embedded iframe
	# at all (the same restriction that stops a malicious page tricking
	# someone into trusting a bad cert) - so Connect/Shadow silently failed
	# for anyone who hadn't separately visited/trusted that port first, with
	# no way to do so from inside the session itself. (3) An EARLIER same-
	# origin attempt, proxied under a DIFFERENT sub-path (/rustdesk-webclient/)
	# with the prefix stripped before forwarding, also failed - not because
	# same-origin is impossible, but because that path didn't match what the
	# Flutter build's own base-href was compiled for (/webclient2/), so its
	# root-relative asset/API references resolved incorrectly. Proxying the

	# ConfigJs handler, only registered when WebClient==1, same source as

	# server to "" via localStorage, which is what makes the /api/shared-peer
	# call below resolve as a same-origin root-relative fetch in the first
	# place. Without this handle block it fell through to the frontend
	# reverse_proxy instead, 404'd, silently never ran - confirmed live: the
	# browser's own Network tab showed both this AND shared-peer 404ing
	# together, api-server staying literally the string "null", and
	# shared-peer's fetch becoming the relative path "null/api/shared-peer",
	# which then also 404'd (resolving under /webclient2/ and matching the
	# handle block above, hitting rustdesk-api's own static 404 for it).
