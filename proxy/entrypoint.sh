# Terminates HTTPS for the whole app and redirects plain HTTP to it. By
# default that's Caddy's own `tls internal`, a zero-config self-signed
# certificate backed by a local CA it generates once and reuses (persisted
# under /data, a named volume, so restarts don't churn out a new one).
# THIS PART MUST NEVER DEPEND ON POSTGRES BEING UP: it's what a user sees
# on the very first boot of a fresh install, before migrations have
# necessarily even finished, and it's also the only thing standing between
# them and a working HTTPS port at all, so it starts immediately no matter
# what Postgres is doing.
#
# Which certificate to use beyond that default is controlled from Settings
# -> HTTPS certificate, which writes a `tls_mode` row straight to Postgres
# the same way every other setting does (see
# backend/app/api/routes/settings.py). This container has no other way to
# learn about that change, so, same idea as updater/update.sh polling for
# update_requested, it polls the settings table on an interval in the
# background and reloads Caddy's config when what it finds no longer
# matches what's currently running. If Postgres or psql is ever
# unreachable, that polling just quietly finds nothing to do, self-signed
# (or whatever was last loaded) keeps serving either way.
